# Stock Grapher

## Overview

The Stock Grapher is a Python tool for visualizing stock price data. It uses yfinance to download historical data for a given stock symbol and displays several technical indicators using plotly. The current indicators implemented are:

EMA (Exponential Moving Average)
RSI (Relative Strength Index)
Stochastic RSI
Additionally, the script includes a custom Range Filter, which is a technical analysis tool used to identify the high and low bands around the stock's closing price, adjusting for volatility.
